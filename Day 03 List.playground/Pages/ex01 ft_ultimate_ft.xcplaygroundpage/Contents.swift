 Files to turn in : ft_ultimate_ft.c

 Allowed functions : Nothing

 Remarks : n/a
 - Create a function that takes a pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to int as a parameter and sets the value "42" to that int.
 - Hereâ€™s how it should be prototyped : void ft_ultimate_ft(int *********nbr);
